Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• The Trump administration said that nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador who have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. since earthquakes devastated their homeland in 2001 must leave the country.

The announcement came after Department of Homeland Security officials said they were ending a humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., ignoring pleas from immigrant advocates and the Salvadoran government to extend it.

The move had its supporters. “We need to put the ‘T’ back into T.P.S.,” one said. Above, Veronica Lagunas and her two children.

• The Chinese authorities warned that an Iranian oil tanker, the Sanchi, that collided with another ship off China’s coast could explode and sink.

Rescuers were searching for the tanker’s crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis. Flames and thick black smoke were seen pouring from the Sanchi in images released by the South Korean Coast Guard and the Chinese state news media.

Greenpeace said the accident may become an environmental disaster.

• Beijing’s regulators are cracking down on Amway, the American marketing giant that found financial salvation in China, growing to more than $2.6 billion in revenue.

Now, Amway and other companies that use sales representatives to recruit others below them — in what’s called multilevel marketing — face public skepticism, and in some cases investigations.

Amway’s name in Chinese, an li, has even entered the vernacular to mean to “promote heavily” or to “be brainwashed.”

• In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani used the recent nationwide protests to attack his hard-line opponents, saying the people who took to the streets did so because they were seeking a better life.

Mr. Rouhani said the protesters objected not just to the bad economy but also to widespread corruption and the clergy-led government’s restrictions on personal conduct.

Even so, Iran over the weekend banned the teaching of English in primary schools after religious leaders warned that it opened the way to a Western “cultural invasion.”

• A senior BBC News editor for China resigned, accusing the network of operating a “secretive and illegal” salary system that pays men more than women in similar positions.

The editor, Carrie Gracie, who joined the BBC 30 years ago, said she only recently learned that her male colleagues earned 50 percent more than she did. She was offered a raise, but still not a salary matching her male counterparts.

“I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,” Ms. Gracie, above, wrote in an open letter posted online.

Backstory

Welcome to the year of purple.

The Pantone Color Institute, which helps manufacturers select colors for designs, has been naming a color of the year since 2000 (It chose Greenery last year, and Rose Quartz — think millennial pink — shared the title with Serenity blue in 2016).

This year the shade is Ultra Violet. “We wanted to pick something that brings hope and an uplifting message,” the institute’s director, Leatrice Eiseman, told The Times.

In ancient times, purple dye was made from the mucus of sea snails in the Phoenician city of Tyre, in what is now Lebanon’s Mediterranean coast.

Because the color was difficult and expensive to produce, it became associated with power and royalty, from ancient Rome to the kingdoms of Europe. In the 1500s, Queen Elizabeth I decreed that only members of the royal family could wear the color.

In 1856, a British chemist, William Henry Perkin, made the color more accessible when he accidentally created a purple dye while trying to concoct a treatment for malaria.

More than 160 years later, a color that’s rare in nature is about to have its moment.
