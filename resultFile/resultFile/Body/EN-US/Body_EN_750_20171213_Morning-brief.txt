Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• The outcome of a contentious election underway in the American South will determine who will take up a vacant U.S. Senate seat — and also forecast Republicans’ chances of holding on to their narrow Senate majority in next year’s votes.

President Trump, who is strongly supporting the Republican Roy Moore (above, on horseback after voting) despite accusations that Mr. Moore accosted teenage girls, lashed out at his own accusers as fabricators and insulted a prominent female senator as someone who “would do anything” for campaign contributions.

And sexual harassment allegations emerged against three television football analysts and a high-powered New York restaurateur.

• New Yorkers mostly kept their fears at bay and the subway turnstiles spinning a day after a botched attack in an underground passageway.

The U.S. government filed terrorism charges against the suspect, Akayed Ullah, 27. Investigators said the Bangladeshi immigrant told them he had been radicalized online and had made a number of trips overseas in the past five years, visiting Bangladesh in recent months.

“He was a good guy,” said a cabdriver who prayed with Mr. Ullah at a Brooklyn mosque. “I can’t believe he would do anything like this.”

• “I will spare the party any further distraction.”

With those words, the Australian opposition lawmaker Sam Dastyari agreed to resign after fending off accusations for months that he pushed China’s foreign policy interests after taking money from Chinese-born political donors.

More than 60 asylum seekers in Australia’s offshore detention program on Manus Island have been called in by American officials to discuss potential resettlement in the U.S.

• Sri Lanka’s recent agreement to hand over its strategic port of Hambantota to China has raised fears for its sovereignty — and concerns that the huge foreign infrastructure investments China is making for its “One Belt, One Road” initiative could end up in international land grabs.

Beneficiaries can find themselves owing China more than they can pay. Sri Lanka owes $8 billion for projects that have sometimes turned out to be white elephants (like the world’s emptiest airport, examined in the Times Magazine in September).

• President Emmanuel Macron of France tried to shore up support for the Paris climate deal by urging heads of state to commit more funding to the fight against global warming.

Some doubt whether the global community achieve the emission goals that were set two years ago, given President Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the deal.

Our international climate correspondent looks at a surprising factor in greenhouse gas emissions: A third of all the food grown on Earth is simply wasted.

• Reviews of “The Last Jedi” are finally out.

Here’s a bit from ours: “Lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever).”

Business

• Westfield, the Australian firm that operates dozens of malls in the U.S. (including at One World Trade Center in New York, above) is being bought for $15.7 billion by Unibail-Rodamco, a Paris-based property investment firm. The combined company would hold property worth $72 billion.

• China shut down big chemical factories in its west for as long as four months to free up natural gas to heat homes, schools and hospitals — another example of how painful and expensive it will be to wean the country off coal.

• Artificial intelligence may make half of today’s jobs obsolete in 20 years. What will be left? (“The robot plumber is a long, long way away.”)

• U.S. stocks were mixed. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

Back Story

The holiday season involves many traditions. For Britons and millions of others around the world, one of them is Queen Elizabeth II’s annual Christmas Day message.

The speech was first given 85 years ago by King George V, her grandfather. “Distant lands thrill to his ‘God bless you,’ ” The Times reported in 1932.

“Farmers in Brisbane, Australia, listened to it in a Summer heat of 95 degrees in the shade,” a correspondent wrote from London, in apparent awe of the radio technology. “Passengers on Atlantic liners heard it as their ship plowed through Winter storms.”

In 1952, the queen gave her first Christmas message, sitting in the chair used by her father and grandfather, The Times reported. According to the BBC, 100 million people heard the speech.

Five years later, the speech was televised for the first time. (Watch it here.) The change occurred, The Times noted, after the queen was criticized for being too remote and surrounded by “tweedy” courtiers.

“That it is possible for some of you to see me today is just another example of the speed at which things are changing all around us,” she said before her speech in 1957.

Further adapting to changing times, the royal family launched a YouTube channel 10 years ago.
