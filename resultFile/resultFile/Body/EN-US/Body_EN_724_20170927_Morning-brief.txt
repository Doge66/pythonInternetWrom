Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Washington and Pyongyang have exchanged heated words, but behind the North’s belligerence and defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons, some analysts see a leadership anxious to avoid a war it can’t win, and careful to leave itself a rhetorical escape route.

“They know how to calculate their stakes,” a security expert said of Pyongyang’s leaders. “They are not reckless.” According to one report, North Korean officials have reached out to Republican-linked analysts in Washington for help interpreting President Trump’s comments.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration continued its effort to isolate the nation, adding eight North Korean banks and 26 individuals. The blacklist hits North Koreans working in China, Russia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates.

And the parents of Otto Warmbier, the American student detained by North Korea who died shortly after he had been flown home in June, said that he had been tortured, describing his captors as “terrorists.”

• A day after Iraqi Kurds voted on independence, the Iraqi prime minister threatened to shut down flights to the region, giving the regional government until Friday to surrender control of two international airports.

The vote held by the Kurdistan Regional Government was nonbinding but was expected to produce an overwhelming “yes” to break away from Baghdad.

Baghdad has rejected the referendum, calling it unconstitutional. The international community, including the U.S., also overwhelmingly opposed it.

• Saudi Arabia said it will finally allow women to drive, ending a policy that has become a symbol of the repression of women in the ultraconservative kingdom.

Momentum to overturn the ban had picked up in recent years, buoyed by the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has laid out a far-reaching plan to reform the kingdom’s economy and society.

Back Story

The box office success of the new film adaptation of Stephen King’s “It” has put evil clowns front and center.

In Australia, near hysteria broke out after a mysterious Facebook group promised to send 50 clowns to one spot. The backlash, including threats of violence, looked like a case study of coulrophobia — clown phobia.

Like a fear of masks, terror of clowns stems from the obscuring of the face, according to Corrie Ackland, clinical director at the Sydney Phobia Clinic. “We use people’s facial expressions as such an indicator of safety and their intentions,” she explained. “And if we don’t get that really important piece of information, then we feel like we should be cautious.”

Phobias can form from childhood experiences, critical events later in life, or gradual processes. With clowns, there’s plenty of disturbing material. In the 1970s, John Wayne Gacy, an amateur clown, tortured and killed at least 33 young men and boys in the U.S. And both the U.S. and Australia grappled with reports in 2016 of clowns terrorizing the public.

Therapy involves gradual exposure in positive settings. For example, said Ms. Ackland, one might take the patient to see the red-haired clown who hides amid burgers and fries: Ronald McDonald.
