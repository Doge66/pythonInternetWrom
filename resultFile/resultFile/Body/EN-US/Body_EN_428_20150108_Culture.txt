French officials are searching for two of the three suspects in Wednesday’s killings at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper.

The Manhunt

The Search Begins

The manhunt extended beyond Paris. One of the three suspects identified by officials surrendered himself to the police in Charleville-Mézières. On Thursday, the police raided a building, shown below, in the Croix-Rouge suburb of Reims, where one of the two remaining suspects lived. Officials also searched a gas station in Villers-Cotterêts that was robbed by two heavily armed men, whom the manager identified as the two missing suspects.

The Search Narrows

Officials on Thursday focused their search on several towns and forests north of Paris, near the gas station in Villers-Cotterêts, and raised the terror alert level for the region to the highest level. France’s interior minister announced that 88,000 police and security forces had been deployed throughout the country.

The Attack

11 Killed in Newspaper Office

At about 11:20 a.m., at least two men armed with AK-47 rifles forced their way into Charlie Hebdo. They began firing in the lobby before going to the second floor, where they fired at journalists in a news meeting, according to a Paris prosecutor. Eleven people were killed, including the newspaper's top editor and a police guard.

Clash With Police

The gunmen faced off with a police patrol as they fled outside, according to the Paris police, clashing with officers a total of three times before escaping the neighborhood.

Police Officer Shot

During their escape, they killed a second police officer as he lay wounded on a nearby street.

Car Abandoned

The gunmen fled in a black Citroën. They crashed into another car and injured its driver, before robbing and abducting a bystander. The police said they found an abandoned car they believed was used by the gunmen about 1.5 miles north of the newspaper.
