he drama “A Touch of Sin,” from the director Jia Zhang-ke, tells four stories of contemporary China that follow working-class characters pushed to the brink of violence when treated with brutality at work and elsewhere. The events in the movie are fictionalized versions of incidents widely reported in the press. The film, which won best screenplay at Cannes in the spring, was shown this week at the New York Film Festival and opens Friday in New York. (See Manohla Dargis’s review.) At Cannes, Mr. Jia spoke about how the film’s visuals and locations played into the stories. Speaking through an interpreter during an interview at the Paramount Hotel in New York, Mr. Jia discussed issues the movie raises. Following are excerpts from that conversation.

Q.

Because the subject matter, was there a concern about how the Chinese government would react?

A.

Personally, I did not take it into direct consideration because I felt that it was a film that had to be made. The last two years, the state of things in China have been very unsettling to me. But people around me, my cinematographer and my producers, did worry because no film in the last few years has attempted to broach this subject.

Q.

There is a kind of grandiose, martial arts quality to the way the violence erupts in these characters. Could you speak about your aesthetic approach to the film?

A.

I was trying to conceive of the direction the script would go, how to go about describing and narrating these events that are different from the subjects my films have dealt with in the past. And then one day I realized that the “wuxia” [martial arts] form could be applied to the telling of these stories.

There are similarities between the characters of wuxia pictures and stories of the past and the people in these contemporary stories. In facing destruction and corruption, and when their survival was threatened, these characters also used violence against the violence inflicted upon them. So I’ve always looked at wuxia films as political allegories.

Q.

In what other ways does this film adhere to the wuxia form?

A.

Another similarity is the theme of migration. The key to the wuxia picture was that each character would make a journey across the country to seek revenge or justice and face many dangers along the way. Now in China, a lot of people are leaving their homes and moving around the country to change their fate. With the violence, the difference with the wuxia picture is that oftentimes the moment of violence becomes highly aestheticized or abstracted. But my approach was to make the violence more direct, to underscore the immediacy of that moment of violence.

Q.

In the context of this film, what do you see the as China’s largest societal problem?

A.

The biggest problem is the threat of personal freedom and pride. In every story in the film, each character tries to resort to lawfulness as a resolution, but to no avail. So the issue, then, is how to express oneself and be heard, because these acts of violence emerge from a place of characters trying to salvage their pride.
