Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Analysts are poring over new hints from North Korea that it is developing more advanced, solid-fuel ballistic missiles. Such missiles are easier to transport and hide up to the moment of launch, reducing their vulnerability to a pre-emptive strike.

The photo above, carried in the main state-run newspaper, showed what appeared to be a conceptual diagram for an “underwater strategic ballistic missile” with an extended range. Submarine launches are also harder to forestall.

• The U.S. Navy removed the commander of the Seventh Fleet after four accidents in Asian waters this year, including two in the past two months that left more than a dozen sailors dead.

• A long wait for South Korea ends Friday, when a verdict is expected in the blockbuster bribery trial of Jay Y. Lee, the heir to the Samsung empire.

Prosecutors are under intense pressure to win a conviction. The defense insists evidence is lacking, and Mr. Lee maintains he was simply naïve in handling requests from a confidante of Park Geun-hye, the president ousted as the case exploded.

Meanwhile, Samsung’s business operations carried on, unveiling the Galaxy Note 8 for the North American market and listing its stops to avoid repeating the overheating and explosions of its Galaxy Note 7.

Back Story

We often go back in history for our back stories, but today we’re going way back.

Mount Vesuvius erupted on this day in 79 A.D., burying the Roman town of Pompeii under a heap of ash, rocks and pumice.

Most of what we know of the event we owe to Pliny the Younger, who described it in a letter to the Roman historian Tacitus. According to the account, in the early afternoon that day, Pliny’s mother told his uncle, Pliny the Elder, that “a cloud which appeared of a very unusual size and shape” was approaching.

“I cannot give you a more exact description,” Pliny the Younger wrote of the cloud, “than by likening it to that of a pine-tree, for it shot up to a great height in the form of a very tall trunk, which spread itself out at the top into a sort of branches.”

Pliny the Elder set off by boat to explore the cloud’s source, encountering “black pieces of burning rock” along the way. Yet he continued onward, reportedly telling his pilot, “Fortune favors the bold.”

The maxim, however — at least that day — proved false.

“He suffocated,” his nephew wrote, “by some gross and noxious vapor.”
