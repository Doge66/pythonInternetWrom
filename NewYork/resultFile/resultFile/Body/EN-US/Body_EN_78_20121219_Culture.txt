As Blu-ray players continue to drop in price and rise in popularity, many distributors are returning to their libraries to create newly restored and remastered editions of enduring classics and popular favorites. The price tag on some of this year’s gift box collections may seem a bit stiff, but per title, the sets can still represent a genuine bargain, particularly given the heavy discounts available at online retailers. (All prices given below are the manufacturer’s suggested retail; in most cases you’ll be able to find markdowns of 30 to 40 percent.) And a well-produced Blu-ray, like Sony’s new edition of “Lawrence of Arabia,” offers a quality of sound and image that none of the streaming services — with their highly compressed digital files — can come close to matching.

Only the seasonal selection seems a bit slim this year, as if the studios were finally running out of holiday-themed movies to reissue. (Here’s a vote for one forgotten title: Joseph Kane’s 1945 film “The Cheaters,” a Republic release.) While chestnuts like “White Christmas” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” remain available, I’ve reached back a little to recommend some less familiar titles from years past.
