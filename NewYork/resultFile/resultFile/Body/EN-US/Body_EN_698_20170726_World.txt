We asked readers who had traveled there to tell us why they went and what they found. Here is a sampling of the responses we received.

• Cardinal George Pell, one of the pope’s top advisers, above, is expected to make his first court appearance in Australia after becoming the highest-ranking Roman Catholic prelate to be formally charged with sexual offenses.

The still-unspecified charges followed years of criticism that he had at best overlooked, and at worst covered up, the widespread abuse of children by clergymen in Australia.

Cardinal Pell has vowed to fight the charges, calling them false and the result of a “relentless character assassination.”

Back Story

“War in a periscope” declared the front page of The Times on this day in 1942.

The headline accompanied a photo from the U.S. Navy, “the first combat action photograph taken through the periscope of an American undersea craft.”

That got us wondering about other photographic firsts at The Times, so we dove into our archives.

The Times published its first photographs on Sept. 6, 1896, in the first edition of its Sunday Magazine. (The pictures were of two of the candidates in the 1860 presidential election. Photos of white, male politicians? Some things never change.)

It took another 13 years for a photo to finally appear on the front page. The Times sponsored a daredevil flight from Albany to New York City and ran a picture of the plane at takeoff.

We experimented with printing in color as far back as the early 20th century, but the front page was strictly black and white until Oct. 16, 1997, when a photo of the World Series-bound Cleveland Indians appeared.
