The North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, honored his government’s 69th anniversary not with another missile test, but with a party for the scientists who carried out the country’s most recent nuclear test, above.

Meanwhile, the White House and the Pentagon are scrambling to decide how to react if North Korea demonstrates that it can send missiles to Guam, or a distance equivalent to striking the West Coast.

Back Story

This month in 1972, the South Pacific Forum of States recognized the Kingdom of Tonga’s sovereignty over two submerged atolls, ending the short life of a micronation unilaterally declared by an American and built on sand.

Michael J. Oliver, a Las Vegas real-estate tycoon with visions of a libertarian utopia, declared the Republic of Minerva nine months earlier. He laid claim to the Minerva Reefs, a pair of remote atolls a foot or so beneath the surface of the South Pacific, named for a ship that had foundered on one.

Morris G. Davis, a developer of the Minuteman missile, was appointed president.

The new country had its own flag and coins, and was free of taxes and regulation. To overcome the small matter of not having any dry land, they brought a barge in to dump sand.

But in June, King Taufa’ahau Tupou IV of Tonga landed at the north atoll with a brass band and a group of convict laborers. The Tongan anthem was played and the Minervan flag was taken down.

The Tongan annexation was soon ratified, setting off a continuing dispute with Fiji. Mr. Oliver went on to foment breakaway independence movements in Vanuatu and the Bahamas. Those failed too.
