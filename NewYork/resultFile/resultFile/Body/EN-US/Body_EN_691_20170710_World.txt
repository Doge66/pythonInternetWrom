Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq arrived in Mosul on Sunday to declare victory over the Islamic State.

Suicide bombers and guerrilla attacks could plague Iraq’s armed forces in the country’s second-largest city for weeks to come, but Mr. Abadi’s presence there formally ends a monthslong campaign that killed thousands of people and displaced nearly a million more.

The Iraqis now face the immense challenge of restoring essential services and rebuilding the city.

Analysts warn that ISIS, despite its losses, remains a potent force for inspiring global terror.

• “Now it is time to move forward.”

Following his first face-to-face meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, President Trump took to Twitter to address Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, stating that he had “strongly pressed” Mr. Putin and declaring it time for the United States to work constructively with Russia.

While Mr. Trump has been dogged by revelations of undisclosed meetings between his associates and Russians, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is said to have arranged a meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer after he was told he would be provided with damaging details about Hillary Clinton.

The June 9 meeting is the first confirmed private meeting between a Russian national and members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle during the campaign.

• The G-20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany, where public splits with President Trump were the order of the day, reflected the newly confrontational stance that European leaders are taking toward the United States.

The other members of the group broke explicitly with the U.S. on the subject of climate change and vowed to move forward collectively, declaring the Paris accord “irreversible.”

An Australian news broadcast that delivered a scathing evaluation of Mr. Trump’s performance at the meeting has gone viral on social media.

• China is facing renewed pressure to release one of its most prominent dissidents.

Liu Xiaobo, a political prisoner and Nobel laureate who is on medical parole in a Chinese hospital to receive treatment for late-stage liver cancer, was declared fit to travel abroad for medical care by American and German doctors on Sunday.

Mr. Liu is serving an 11-year sentence after being convicted of state subversion. Our Opinion columnist calls him “the Mandela of our age.”

Back Story

Like music? Then you might want to check out the Montreux Jazz Festival.

It’s underway on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland. If you happen to be — like us — elsewhere, you can stream the concerts live on the festival’s website.

Once devoted almost entirely to European jazz, it has evolved into something far more inclusive. Its founder, Claude Nobs, was criticized for continuing to use the term “jazz” to describe the event even after other styles of music were introduced.

“Montreux Jazz is a brand name, and most of the people know what to expect,” Mr. Nobs, who died in 2013, said in a 2006 interview with Billboard magazine.

This year, the festival’s eclectic program included sold-out concerts by the British pop stars The Pet Shop Boys and the American R&B singer Lauryn Hill. The Senegalese singer Youssou N’Dour is scheduled to perform on the final day, next Saturday.

The festival has also been a prolific venue for recording. The pianist Bill Evans recorded a Grammy-winning album there in the second year, kicking off a series that comprises what is now an extensive audio archive recognized by Unesco.
