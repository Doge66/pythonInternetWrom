Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• President Trump arrives in China after visiting South Korea, where he dropped his fiery threats and derisive references to North Korea and assured the anxious officials in Seoul that the region’s nuclear standoff “will all work out.”

And instead of threatening pre-emptive action, Mr. Trump said he prayed that using military force wouldn’t be necessary, adding that it would be in North Korea’s interest to “come to the table and to make a deal.” Above, Mr. Trump with President Moon Jae-in in Seoul on Tuesday.

Separately, 10 North Korean defectors, including a 3-year-old boy and his mother, were arrested in China and may be deported, an activist in South Korea said.

• The Texas church gunman who killed 26 people on Sunday once escaped from a psychiatric hospital after making death threats against his superiors, according to a 2012 police report.

He was also court-martialed from the U.S. Air Force for domestic violence. But that information was not entered into a database that could have prevented him from buying a military-style rifle. President Trump suggested that stricter gun laws could have worsened the toll.

After each mass shooting, the question arises: Why does the U.S. have such a high rate of them? Americans have a lot of theories, but our Interpreter columnists say the answer is lying in plain sight.

• The movie mogul Harvey Weinstein hired private detectives, lawyers and undercover agents to try to scuttle articles about accusations of sexual harassment and assault against him, The New Yorker reported.

As the allegations pile up, our gender editor looks at how social media, famous accusers and a generational change have added up to a profound shift in how we talk about sexual harassment.

• And new research on mammoth fossils suggests that male pachyderms died in more “silly ways” than their female counterparts. “In many species, males tend to do somewhat stupid things,” a biologist said.

Back Story

Bram Stoker’s immortality is proving more unpierceable than that of his bloodthirsty creation, Dracula.

Stoker, who was born in Ireland on this day in 1847, gave everlasting life to Dracula, the Transylvanian vampire, in the 1897 novel of the same name, and then took it away.

Since then, Stoker’s tale has been reimagined countless times, in books, on television and in films, like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992).

Now, one of his descendants is hoping to revive previously unpublished parts of the story.

Stoker took seven years to write the original novel, clawing his way through an overabundance of imagination and research that left much of the material in drafts.

The novelist’s great grandnephew Dacre Stoker announced he will release a prequel, “Dracul,” in 2018. It draws heavily from Bram Stoker’s original notes and private journal, and from family legends. Paramount has already bought the movie rights, so Dracula may be resurrected on the big screen once again.
