Good morning. A stolen Oscar, a Belarusian escort and a meeting in Pyongyang. Here’s what you need to know.

• Promises of more blues skies and less economic risk were among the highlights of the opening day of China’s annual state-of-the-nation report to lawmakers, the National People’s Congress.

Premier Li Keqiang also announced an increase about $175 billion for the People’s Liberation Army.

Still to come: the expected abolishment of presidential term limits, enabling Xi Jinping to solidify his rule. Our Beijing correspondent writes: “Hagiography aside, what is striking is how little is known about Mr. Xi’s biography as a leader.”

Bad news for China’s antipollution push: S.U.V.s now make up more than one in three cars sold globally, because drivers in China (along with Australia and Europe) are ditching sedans.

• Tariff confusion.

Among the many unanswered questions about the measures on steel and aluminum President Trump plans to sign this week, the first is: Who will be hit?

The White House had insisted there would be no exceptions, but in a confounding tweet, Mr. Trump said the tariffs would “come off” of Canada and Mexico if a new and “fair” multilateral trade pact were signed.

A top Republican congressman broke ranks with Mr. Trump over the tariffs, saying: “We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war.”

• “If America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know.”

That’s the deal on offer from a Belarusian escort jailed in Bangkok, above. She told our reporter that she has recordings that contain evidence of Russian meddling in U.S. elections.

Her assertion would be easy to disregard, were it not for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month by a Russian opposition figure that relies heavily on her footage and photographs.

• Top aides of South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, met with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in Pyongyang in a bid to improve inter-Korean relations and help start a dialogue between the North and the U.S.

Mr. Moon’s spokesman said the envoys were the first South Korean officials to visit the North in 11 years, and that they carried a personal letter from Mr. Moon to Mr. Kim.

After returning home, the South Korean envoys will fly to Washington for follow-up discussions with the Trump administration.

• And we went all out for the Oscars. Here are the highs and lows of the 90th Academy Awards.

“The Shape of Water” and its director, Guillermo del Toro, were the big winners. Jordan Peele, above with his mother Lucinda Williams, became the first African-American to win the best original screenplay for “Get Out.” Here’s the full list.

The #MeToo movement also had a starring role, but someone (briefly) stole Frances McDormand’s Oscar.

Read our wrap-up of the night, and here are photos from the red carpet.

Our TV critic said the show was “mainly notable for acknowledging troubles that are harder to fix” than last year’s envelope mixup.

• Shared bathrooms. No solo kitchen. But there is wine night.

Dorm rooms are making a comeback in a new demographic: professionals. At least that’s the case in San Francisco, where the tech sector has sent rents into the stratosphere.

“I feel like I’m in a relationship with everyone I live with,” said a 25-year-old resident. “If their day is bad, your day is bad.”

• China listed a $400 million theme park on Australia’s Gold Coast, built by the Chinese developer Songcheng, as a “key project” linked to its Belt and Road initiative.

• Thanks to an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., the messaging company Telegram is on track to raise $1 billion in four months. (It took Facebook seven years to get there.)

• U.S. stocks were up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

Back Story

For today’s back story, we’re introducing what we hope will become a regular feature, courtesy of our friends at The New York Times’s crossword column, Wordplay.

Each week, the column’s editor, Deb Amlen, will highlight the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles. Please let us know how you like it.

This week’s word: sazerac.

It has only appeared in the Times Crossword three times over the past few years, most recently in last Friday’s puzzle.

The sazerac is a 180-year-old cocktail based on rye and bitters. Even if you don’t imbibe, it’s certainly a fun name to say.

The story of the drink begins in mid-19th century New Orleans, where an apothecary owner, Antoine Amedie Peychaud, treated his friends to brandy toddies containing a French brandy called Sazerac and a dash of the bitters made from a secret family recipe.

By 1850, the sazerac became the first “branded” cocktail, and in 1873, the brandy was replaced by American rye whiskey, with a dash of absinthe.

Over the years, Herbsaint, another anise-flavored pastis, has been used in place of absinthe and the “official” sazerac recipe was modified to use Sazerac Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey.

Our Cooking section also features a version made with absinthe.
