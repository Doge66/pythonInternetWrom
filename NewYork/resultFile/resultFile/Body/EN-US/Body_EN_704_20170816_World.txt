Good morning.

Here’s what you need to know:

• President Moon Jae-in of South Korea issued a blunt rebuke to the United States, the latest sign that President Trump’s “fire-and-fury” approach to North Korea was putting new strain on the longstanding alliance.

“No one should be allowed to decide on a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean agreement,” Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised speech.

Pyongyang appeared to walk back its threat to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam, saying it would wait to assess “the foolish and stupid conduct” of the United States.

Here are the key questions about the North’s threat to Guam, where our correspondent found that many residents seem to be taking things in stride.

• President Trump angrily defended himself against a torrent of bipartisan criticism for waiting several days before naming Nazi and white supremacist groups and placing blame on “many sides” for the weekend’s deadly racial unrest in Virginia.

Of the many theories about the president’s reluctance to criticize far-right activists is that Stephen Bannon, above center, cautioned him against antagonizing the small but energetic part of his base. Mr. Bannon’s place at the White House, though, is now in limbo.

More corporate leaders, including executives from Walmart, Intel and Under Armour, came forward to condemn Mr. Trump. Here are the C.E.O.’s on the president’s councils.

And three days after a driver rammed into a crowd in Virginia, Mr. Trump shared on Twitter a cartoon of a train running over a person adorned with a CNN logo. He deleted his retweet minutes later, and the White house said it had been posted inadvertently.

• Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, had strong words for the United States and warned that the country’s nuclear program could be restarted in a matter of “hours,” if the American government imposes further sanctions on Tehran.

Back Story

Today in 1930, a dancing frog set a new standard in animation.

“Fiddlesticks,” featuring Flip the Frog, above, was a stand-alone cartoon with synchronized sound. (Watch it here.)

By that year, music had been widely used to accompany animations. Some of the more laborious animations were even in color. Then around 1930, those two features were combined.

In Germany, Lotte Reiniger’s character silhouettes of the 1920s used changing background colors to create atmospheric scenes. In the U.S., “King of Jazz” in 1930 featured a short color animation with synchronized sound.

In “Fiddlesticks,” Flip the Frog tap-dances his way through a world of merry animals, but then is moved to tears as he plays the piano alongside a violin-playing rodent that resembled Mickey Mouse.

The animation was released by Ub Iwerks, who had helped produce Mickey Mouse, shortly after he left Walt Disney’s growing enterprise. The Flip franchise ended in 1933, and Mr. Iwerks returned to work at Disney.

But he never stopped innovating.

His obituary noted that he invented “a panoramic camera arrangement.” Imagine his excitement if he could see today’s 360-degree cartoons.
